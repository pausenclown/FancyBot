=head1 NAME

File::ChangeNotify::Watcher::KQueue - KQueue-based watcher subclass

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements watching using L<IO::KQueue>, which must be installed
for it to work. This is a BSD alternative to Linux's Inotify and similar
event-based systems.

=head1 CAVEATS

Although this watcher is more efficient and accurate than the
C<File::ChangeNotify::Watcher::Default> class, in order to monitor files and
directories, it must open filehandles to each of them. Because many BSD
systems have relatively low defaults for the maximum number of files each
process can open, you may find you run out of file descriptors.

On FreeBSD, you can check (and alter) your system's settings with C<sysctl> if
necessary. The important keys are: C<kern.maxfiles> and
C<kern.maxfilesperproc>.  You can see how many files your system current has
open with C<kern.openfiles>.

=head1 SUPPORT

I (Dave Rolsky) cannot test this class, as I have no BSD systems. Reasonable
patches will be applied as-is, and when possible I will consult with Dan
Thomas or other BSD users before releasing.
