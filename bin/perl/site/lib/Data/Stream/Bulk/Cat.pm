=head1 NAME

Data::Stream::Bulk::Cat - Concatenated streams

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Stream::Bulk::Cat;

	Data::Stream::Bulk::Cat->new(
		streams => [ $s1, $s2, $s3 ],
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This stream is a concatenation of several other streams.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item is_done

Returns true if the list of streams is empty.

=item next

Returns the next block from the next ready stream.

=item list_cat

Breaks down the internal list of streams, and delegates C<list_cat> to the
first one.

Has the effect of inlining the nested streams into the total concatenation,
allowing L<Data::Stream::Bulk::Array/list_cat> to work better.
