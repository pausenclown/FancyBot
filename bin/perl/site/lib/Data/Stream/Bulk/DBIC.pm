=head1 NAME

Data::Stream::Bulk::DBIC - Iterate DBIC resultsets with L<Data::Stream::Bulk>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	Data::Stream::Bulk::DBIC->new(
		resultset => scalar($schema->rs("Foo")->search(...))
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a wrapper for L<DBIx::Class::ResultSet> that fits the
L<Data::Stream::Bulk> api.

Due to the fact that DBIC inflation overhead is fairly negligiable to that of
iteration though, I haven't actually bothered to make it bulk.

If L<DBIx::Class::Cursor> will support n-at-a-time fetching as opposed to
one-at-a-time or all-at-a-time at some point in the future this class will be
updated to match.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item get_more

See L<Data::Stream::Bulk::DoneFlag>.

Returns a single row. In the future this should return more than one row.
