=head1 NAME

Data::Stream::Bulk::DBI - N-at-a-time iteration of L<DBI> statement results.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Data::Stream::Bulk::DBI;

	my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT hate FROM sql"); # very big resultset
	$sth->execute;

	return Data::Stream::Bulk::DBI->new(
		sth => $sth,
		max_rows => $n, # how many at a time
		slice => [ ... ], # if you want to pass the first param to fetchall_arrayref
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This implementation of L<Data::Stream::Bulk> api works with DBI statement
handles, using L<DBI/fetchall_arrayref>.

It fetches C<max_rows> at a time (defaults to 500).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item sth

The statement handle to call C<fetchall_arrayref> on.

=item slice

Passed verbatim as the first param to C<fetchall_arrayref>. Should usually be
C<undef>, provided for completetness.

=item max_rows

The second param to C<fetchall_arrayref>. Controls the size of each buffer.

Defaults to 500.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

See L<Data::Stream::Bulk::DoneFlag>.

Calls C<fetchall_arrayref> to get the next chunk of rows.

=item all

Calls C<fetchall_arrayref> to get the raminder of the data (without specifying
C<max_rows>).
