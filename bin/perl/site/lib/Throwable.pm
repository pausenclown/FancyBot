=head1 NAME

Throwable - a role for classes that can be thrown

=head1 VERSION

version 0.101110

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Redirect;
  use Moose;
  with 'Throwable';

  has url => (is => 'ro');

...then later...

  Redirect->throw({ url => $url });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as exceptions to
standard program flow.  It is very simple and does only two things: saves any
previous value for C<$@> and calls C<die $self>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 previous_exception

This attribute is created automatically, and stores the value of C<$@> when the
Throwable object is created.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 throw

  Something::Throwable->throw({ attr => $value });

This method will call new, passing all arguments along to new, and will then
use the created object as the only argument to C<die>.

If called on an object that does Throwable, the object will be rethrown.
