=head1 NAME

Moose::Object - The base object for Moose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the default base class for all Moose-using classes. When
you C<use Moose> in this class, your class will inherit from this
class.

It provides a default constructor and destructor, which run the
C<BUILDALL> and C<DEMOLISHALL> methods respectively.

You don't actually I<need> to inherit from this in order to use Moose,
but it makes it easier to take advantage of all of Moose's features.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<< Moose::Object->new(%params) >>

This method calls C<< $class->BUILDARGS(@_) >>, and then creates a new
instance of the appropriate class. Once the instance is created, it
calls C<< $instance->BUILDALL($params) >>.

=item B<< Moose::Object->BUILDARGS(%params) >>

The default implementation of this method accepts a hash or hash
reference of named parameters. If it receives a single argument that
I<isn't> a hash reference it throws an error.

You can override this method in your class to handle other types of
options passed to the constructor.

This method should always return a hash reference of named options.

=item B<< $object->BUILDALL($params) >>

This method will call every C<BUILD> method in the inheritance
hierarchy, starting with the most distant parent class and ending with
the object's class.

The C<BUILD> method will be passed the hash reference returned by
C<BUILDARGS>.

=item B<< $object->DEMOLISHALL >>

This will call every C<DEMOLISH> method in the inheritance hierarchy,
starting with the object's class and ending with the most distant
parent. C<DEMOLISHALL> and C<DEMOLISH> will receive a boolean
indicating whether or not we are currently in global destruction.

=item B<< $object->does($role_name) >>

This returns true if the object does the given role.

=item B<DOES ($class_or_role_name)>

This is a a Moose role-aware implementation of L<UNIVERSAL/DOES>.

This is effectively the same as writing:

  $object->does($name) || $object->isa($name)

This method will work with Perl 5.8, which did not implement
C<UNIVERSAL::DOES>.

=item B<< $object->dump($maxdepth) >>

This is a handy utility for C<Data::Dumper>ing an object. By default,
the maximum depth is 1, to avoid making a mess.
