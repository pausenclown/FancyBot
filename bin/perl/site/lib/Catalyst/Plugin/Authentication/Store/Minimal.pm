    ### If a user does 'use Catalyst qw/Authentication::Store::Minimal/'
    ### he will be proxied on to this setup routine (and only then --
    ### non plugins should NOT have their setup routine invoked!)
    ### Beware what we pass to the 'new' routine; it wants
    ### a config has with a top level key 'users'. New style
    ### configs do not have this, and split by realms. If we
    ### blindly pass this to new, we will 1) overwrite what we
    ### already passed and 2) make ->userhash undefined, which
    ### leads to:
    ###  Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at
    ###  lib/Catalyst/Authentication/Store/Minimal.pm line 38.
    ###
    ### So only do this compatibility call if:
    ### 1) we have a {users} config directive
    ###
    ### Ideally we could also check for:
    ### 2) we don't already have a ->userhash
    ### however, that's an attribute of an object we can't
    ### access =/ --kane
