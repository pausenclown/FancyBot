=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Action::REST - Automated REST Method Dispatching

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    sub foo :Local :ActionClass('REST') {
      ... do setup for HTTP method specific handlers ...
    }

    sub foo_GET {
      ... do something for GET requests ...
    }

    # alternatively use an Action
    sub foo_PUT : Action {
      ... do something for PUT requests ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Action handles doing automatic method dispatching for REST requests.  It
takes a normal Catalyst action, and changes the dispatch to append an
underscore and method name.  First it will try dispatching to an action with
the generated name, and failing that it will try to dispatch to a regular
method.

For example, in the synopsis above, calling GET on "/foo" would result in
the foo_GET method being dispatched.

If a method is requested that is not implemented, this action will
return a status 405 (Method Not Found).  It will populate the "Allow" header
with the list of implemented request methods.  You can override this behavior
by implementing a custom 405 handler like so:

   sub foo_not_implemented {
      ... handle not implemented methods ...
   }

If you do not provide an _OPTIONS subroutine, we will automatically respond
with a 200 OK.  The "Allow" header will be populated with the list of
implemented request methods.

It is likely that you really want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>,
which brings this class together with automatic Serialization of requests
and responses.

When you use this module, it adds the L<Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST>
role to your request class.

=item dispatch

This method overrides the default dispatch mechanism to the re-dispatching
mechanism described above.

=head1 SEE ALSO

You likely want to look at L<Catalyst::Controller::REST>, which implements a
sensible set of defaults for a controller doing REST.

This class automatically adds the L<Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST> role to
your request class.  If you're writing a webapp which provides RESTful
responses and still needs to accommodate web browsers, you may prefer to use
L<Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST::ForBrowsers> instead.

L<Catalyst::Action::Serialize>, L<Catalyst::Action::Deserialize>

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=over 4

=item Q: I'm getting a "415 Unsupported Media Type" error. What gives?!

A:  Most likely, you haven't set Content-type equal to "application/json", or
one of the accepted return formats.  You can do this by setting it in your query
accepted return formats.  You can do this by setting it in your query string
thusly: C<< ?content-type=application%2Fjson (where %2F == / uri escaped). >>

B<NOTE> Apache will refuse %2F unless configured otherwise.
Make sure C<AllowEncodedSlashes On> is in your httpd.conf file in order
for this to run smoothly.
