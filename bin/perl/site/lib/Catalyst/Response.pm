=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Response - stores output responding to the current client request

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $res = $c->response;
    $res->body;
    $res->code;
    $res->content_encoding;
    $res->content_length;
    $res->content_type;
    $res->cookies;
    $res->header;
    $res->headers;
    $res->output;
    $res->redirect;
    $res->status;
    $res->write;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Catalyst Response class, which provides methods for responding to
the current client request. The appropriate L<Catalyst::Engine> for your environment
will turn the Catalyst::Response into a HTTP Response and return it to the client.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $res->body( $text | $fh | $iohandle_object )

    $c->response->body('Catalyst rocks!');

Sets or returns the output (text or binary data). If you are returning a large body,
you might want to use a L<IO::Handle> type of object (Something that implements the read method
in the same fashion), or a filehandle GLOB. Catalyst
will write it piece by piece into the response.

=head2 $res->has_body

Predicate which returns true when a body has been set.

=head2 $res->code

Alias for $res->status.

=head2 $res->content_encoding

Shortcut for $res->headers->content_encoding.

=head2 $res->content_length

Shortcut for $res->headers->content_length.

=head2 $res->content_type

Shortcut for $res->headers->content_type.

This value is typically set by your view or plugin. For example,
L<Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple> will guess the mime type based on the file
it found, while L<Catalyst::View::TT> defaults to C<text/html>.

=head2 $res->cookies

Returns a reference to a hash containing cookies to be set. The keys of the
hash are the cookies' names, and their corresponding values are hash
references used to construct a L<CGI::Simple::Cookie> object.

    $c->response->cookies->{foo} = { value => '123' };

The keys of the hash reference on the right correspond to the L<CGI::Simple::Cookie>
parameters of the same name, except they are used without a leading dash.
Possible parameters are:

=over

=item value

=item expires

=item domain

=item path

=item secure

=item httponly

=back

=head2 $res->header

Shortcut for $res->headers->header.

=head2 $res->headers

Returns an L<HTTP::Headers> object, which can be used to set headers.

    $c->response->headers->header( 'X-Catalyst' => $Catalyst::VERSION );

=head2 $res->output

Alias for $res->body.

=head2 $res->redirect( $url, $status )

Causes the response to redirect to the specified URL. The default status is
C<302>.

    $c->response->redirect( 'http://slashdot.org' );
    $c->response->redirect( 'http://slashdot.org', 307 );

This is a convenience method that sets the Location header to the
redirect destination, and then sets the response status.  You will
want to C< return > or C<< $c->detach() >> to interrupt the normal
processing flow if you want the redirect to occur straight away.

=cut

sub redirect {
    my $self = shift;

    if (@_) {
        my $location = shift;
        my $status   = shift || 302;

        $self->location($location);
        $self->status($status);
    }

    return $self->location;
}

=head2 $res->location

Sets or returns the HTTP 'Location'.

=head2 $res->status

Sets or returns the HTTP status.

    $c->response->status(404);

$res->code is an alias for this, to match HTTP::Response->code.

=head2 $res->write( $data )

Writes $data to the output stream.

=head2 meta

Provided by Moose

=head2 $res->print( @data )

Prints @data to the output stream, separated by $,.  This lets you pass
the response object to functions that want to write to an L<IO::Handle>.

=cut

sub print {
    my $self = shift;
    my $data = shift;

    defined $self->write($data) or return;

    for (@_) {
        defined $self->write($,) or return;
        defined $self->write($_) or return;
    }

    return 1;
}
