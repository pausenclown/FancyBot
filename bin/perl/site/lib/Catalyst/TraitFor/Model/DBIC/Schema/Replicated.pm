=head1 NAME

Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Schema::Replicated - Replicated storage support for
L<Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema>

=head1 SYNOPSiS

    __PACKAGE__->config({
        traits => ['Replicated']
        connect_info =>
            ['dbi:mysql:master', 'user', 'pass'],
        replicants => [
            ['dbi:mysql:slave1', 'user', 'pass'],
            ['dbi:mysql:slave2', 'user', 'pass'],
            ['dbi:mysql:slave3', 'user', 'pass'],
        ],
        balancer_args => {
          master_read_weight => 0.3
        }
    });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets your storage_type to L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated> and connects
replicants provided in config. See that module for supported resultset
attributes.

The default L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated/balancer_type> is
C<::Random>.

Sets the
L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Balancer::Random/master_read_weight> to
C<1> by default, meaning that you have the same chance of reading from master as
you do from replicants. Set to C<0> to turn off reads from master.

=head1 CONFIG PARAMETERS

=head2 replicants

Array of connect_info settings for every replicant.

The following can be set via L<Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema/connect_info>, or
as their own parameters. If set via separate parameters, they will override the
settings in C<connect_info>.

=head2 pool_type

See L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated/pool_type>.

=head2 pool_args

See L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated/pool_args>.

=head2 balancer_type

See L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated/balancer_type>.

=head2 balancer_args

See L<DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated/balancer_args>.
