=head1 NAME

Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST - A role to apply to Catalyst::Request giving it REST methods and attributes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     if ( $c->request->accepts('application/json') ) {
         ...
     }

     my $types = $c->request->accepted_content_types();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Moose::Role> applied to L<Catalyst::Request> that adds a few
methods to the request object to facilitate writing REST-y code.
Currently, these methods are all related to the content types accepted by
the client.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item data

If the request went through the Deserializer action, this method will
return the deserialized data structure.

=item accepted_content_types

Returns an array reference of content types accepted by the
client.

The list of types is created by looking at the following sources:

=over 8

=item * Content-type header

If this exists, this will always be the first type in the list.

=item * content-type parameter

If the request is a GET request and there is a "content-type"
parameter in the query string, this will come before any types in the
Accept header.

=item * Accept header

This will be parsed and the types found will be ordered by the
relative quality specified for each type.

=back

If a type appears in more than one of these places, it is ordered based on
where it is first found.

=item preferred_content_type

This returns the first content type found. It is shorthand for:

  $request->accepted_content_types->[0]

=item accepts($type)

Given a content type, this returns true if the type is accepted.

Note that this does not do any wildcard expansion of types.
