=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Devel - Catalyst Development Tools

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Catalyst-Devel> distribution includes a variety of modules useful
for the development of Catalyst applications, but not required to run
them. This is intended to make it easier to deploy Catalyst apps. The
runtime parts of Catalyst are now known as C<Catalyst::Runtime>. 

C<Catalyst-Devel> includes the L<Catalyst::Helper> system, which
autogenerates scripts and tests; L<Module::Install::Catalyst>, a
L<Module::Install> extension for Catalyst; and requirements for a
variety of development-related modules. The documentation remains with
L<Catalyst::Runtime>.
