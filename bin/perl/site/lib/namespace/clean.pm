namespace::clean - Keep imports and functions out of your namespace

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;
  use warnings;
  use strict;

  use Carp qw(croak);   # 'croak' will be removed

  sub bar { 23 }        # 'bar' will be removed

  # remove all previously defined functions
  use namespace::clean;

  sub baz { bar() }     # 'baz' still defined, 'bar' still bound

  # begin to collection function names from here again
  no namespace::clean;

  sub quux { baz() }    # 'quux' will be removed

  # remove all functions defined after the 'no' unimport
  use namespace::clean;

  # Will print: 'No', 'No', 'Yes' and 'No'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Keeping packages clean

When you define a function, or import one, into a Perl package, it will
naturally also be available as a method. This does not per se cause
problems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin
classes that are included via multiple inheritance by loading them as
base classes.

The C<namespace::clean> pragma will remove all previously declared or
imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle.
Functions called in the package itself will still be bound by their
name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.

By unimporting via C<no> you can tell C<namespace::clean> to start
collecting functions for the next C<use namespace::clean;> specification.

You can use the C<-except> flag to tell C<namespace::clean> that you
don't want it to remove a certain function or method. A common use would
be a module exporting an C<import> method along with some functions:

  use ModuleExportingImport;
  use namespace::clean -except => [qw( import )];

If you just want to C<-except> a single sub, you can pass it directly.
For more than one value you have to use an array reference.

=head2 Explicitely removing functions when your scope is compiled

It is also possible to explicitely tell C<namespace::clean> what packages
to remove when the surrounding scope has finished compiling. Here is an
example:

  package Foo;
  use strict;

  # blessed NOT available

  sub my_class {
      use Scalar::Util qw( blessed );
      use namespace::clean qw( blessed );

      # blessed available
      return blessed shift;
  }

  # blessed NOT available

=head2 Moose

When using C<namespace::clean> together with L<Moose> you want to keep
the installed C<meta> method. So your classes should look like:

  package Foo;
  use Moose;
  use namespace::clean -except => 'meta';
  ...

Same goes for L<Moose::Role>.

=head2 Cleaning other packages

You can tell C<namespace::clean> that you want to clean up another package
instead of the one importing. To do this you have to pass in the C<-cleanee>
option like this:

  package My::MooseX::namespace::clean;
  use strict;

  use namespace::clean (); # no cleanup, just load

  sub import {
      namespace::clean->import(
        -cleanee => scalar(caller),
        -except  => 'meta',
      );
  }

If you don't care about C<namespace::clean>s discover-and-C<-except> logic, and
just want to remove subroutines, try L</clean_subroutines>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 clean_subroutines

This exposes the actual subroutine-removal logic.

  namespace::clean->clean_subroutines($cleanee, qw( subA subB ));

will remove C<subA> and C<subB> from C<$cleanee>. Note that this will remove the
subroutines B<immediately> and not wait for scope end. If you want to have this
effect at a specific time (e.g. C<namespace::clean> acts on scope compile end)
it is your responsibility to make sure it runs at that time.

=head2 import

Makes a snapshot of the current defined functions and installs a
L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope> hook in the current scope to invoke the cleanups.

=head2 unimport

This method will be called when you do a

  no namespace::clean;

It will start a new section of code that defines functions to clean up.

=head2 get_class_store

This returns a reference to a hash in a passed package containing
information about function names included and excluded from removal.

=head2 get_functions

Takes a class as argument and returns all currently defined functions
in it as a hash reference with the function name as key and a typeglob
reference to the symbol as value.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

This module works through the effect that a

  delete $SomePackage::{foo};

will remove the C<foo> symbol from C<$SomePackage> for run time lookups
(e.g., method calls) but will leave the entry alive to be called by
already resolved names in the package itself. C<namespace::clean> will
restore and therefor in effect keep all glob slots that aren't C<CODE>.

A test file has been added to the perl core to ensure that this behaviour
will be stable in future releases.

Just for completeness sake, if you want to remove the symbol completely,
use C<undef> instead.
