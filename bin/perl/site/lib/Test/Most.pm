=head1 NAME

Test::Most - Most commonly needed test functions and features.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.21

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.21';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module provides you with the most commonly used testing functions and
gives you a bit more fine-grained control over your test suite.

    use Test::Most tests => 4, 'die';

    ok 1, 'Normal calls to ok() should succeed';
    is 2, 2, '... as should all passing tests';
    eq_or_diff [3], [4], '... but failing tests should die';
    ok 4, '... will never get to here';

As you can see, the C<eq_or_diff> test will fail.  Because 'die' is in the
import list, the test program will halt at that point.

=head1 EXPORT

All functions from the following modules will automatically be exported into
your namespace:

=over 4

=item * C<Test::More>

=item * C<Test::Exception>

=item * C<Test::Differences>

=item * C<Test::Deep> 

=item * C<Test::Warn>

=back

Functions which are I<optionally> exported from any of those modules must be
referred to by their fully-qualified name:

  Test::Deep::render_stack( $var, $stack );

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Several other functions are also automatically exported:

=head2 C<die_on_fail>

 die_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we throw an exception if this fails';

This function, if called, will cause the test program to throw a
L<Test::Most::Exception>, effectively halting the test.

=head2 C<bail_on_fail>

 bail_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we bail out if this fails';

This function, if called, will cause the test suite to BAIL_OUT() if any
tests fail after it.

=head2 C<restore_fail>

 die_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we throw an exception if this fails';

 restore_fail;
 cmp_bag(\@got, \@bag, '... we will not throw an exception if this fails';

This restores the original test failure behavior, so subsequent tests will no
longer throw an exception or BAIL_OUT().

=head2 C<set_failure_handler>

If you prefer other behavior to 'die_on_fail' or 'bail_on_fail', you can can
set your own failure handler:

 set_failure_handler( sub {
     my $builder = shift;
     if ( $builder && $builder->{Test_Results}[-1] =~ /critical/ ) {
        send_admin_email("critical failure in tests");
     }
 } );

It receives the C<< Test::Builder >> instance as its only argument.  

B<Important>:  Note that if the failing test is the very last test run, then
the C<$builder> will likely be undefined.  This is an unfortunate side effect
of how C<Test::Builder> has been designed.

=head2 C<explain>

Similar to C<diag()>, but only outputs the message if C<$ENV{TEST_VERBOSE}> is
set.  This is typically set by using the C<-v> switch with C<prove>.

Unlike C<diag()>, any reference in the argument list is autumatically expanded
using C<Data::Dumper>.  Thus, instead of this:

 my $self = Some::Object->new($id);
 use Data::Dumper;
 explain 'I was just created', Dumper($self);

You can now just do this:

 my $self = Some::Object->new($id);
 explain 'I was just created:  ', $self;

That output will look similar to:

 I was just created: bless( {
   'id' => 2,
   'stack' => []
 }, 'Some::Object' )

Note that the "dumpered" output has the C<Data::Dumper> variables
C<$Indent>, C<Sortkeys> and C<Terse> all set to the value of C<1> (one).  This
allows for a much cleaner diagnostic output and at the present time cannot be
overridden.

Requires C<Test::Harness> 3.07 or greater.

=head2 C<show>

Experimental.  Just like C<explain>, but also tries to show you the lexical
variable names:

 my $var   = 3;
 my @array = qw/ foo bar /;
 show $var, \@array;
 __END__
 $var = 3;
 @array = [
     'foo',
     'bar'
 ];

It will show C<$VAR1>, C<$VAR2> ... C<$VAR_N> for every variable it cannot
figure out the variable name to:

 my @array = qw/ foo bar /;
 show @array;
 __END__
 $VAR1 = 'foo';
 $VAR2 = 'bar';

Note that this relies on L<Data::Dumper::Names> version 0.03 or greater.  If
this is not present, it will warn and call L<explain> instead.  Also, it can
only show the names for lexical variables.  Globals such as C<%ENV> or C<%@>
are not accessed via PadWalker and thus cannot be shown.  It would be nice to
find a workaround for this.

=head2 C<all_done>

If the plan is specified as C<defer_plan>, you may call C<&all_done> at the
end of the test with an optional test number.  This lets you set the plan
without knowing the plan before you run the tests.

If you call it without a test number, the tests will still fail if you don't
get to the end of the test.  This is useful if you don't want to specify a
plan but the tests exit unexpectedly.  For example, the following would
I<pass> with C<no_plan> but fails with C<all_done>.

 use Test::More 'defer_plan';
 ok 1;
 exit;
 ok 2;
 all_done;

See L<Deferred plans> for more information.

=head1 DIE OR BAIL ON FAIL

Sometimes you want your test suite to throw an exception or BAIL_OUT() if a
test fails.  In order to provide maximum flexibility, there are three ways to
accomplish each of these.

=head2 Import list

 use Test::Most 'die', tests => 7;
 use Test::Most qw< no_plan bail >;

If C<die> or C<bail> is anywhere in the import list, the test program/suite
will throw a C<Test::Most::Exception> or C<BAIL_OUT()> as appropriate the
first time a test fails.  Calling C<restore_fail> anywhere in the test program
will restore the original behavior (not throwing an exception or bailing out).

=head2 Functions

 use Test::Most 'no_plan;
 ok $bar, 'The test suite will continue if this passes';

 die_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we throw an exception if this fails';

 restore_fail;
 ok $baz, 'The test suite will continue if this passes';

The C<die_on_fail> and C<bail_on_fail> functions will automatically set the
desired behavior at runtime.

=head2 Deferred plans

 use Test::Most qw<defer_plan>;
 use My::Tests;
 my $test_count = My::Tests->run;
 all_done($test_count);

Sometimes it's difficult to know the plan up front, but you can calculate the
plan as your tests run.  As a result, you want to defer the plan until the end
of the test.  Typically, the best you can do is this:

 use Test::More 'no_plan';
 use My::Tests;
 My::Tests->run;

But when you do that, C<Test::Builder> merely asserts that the number of tests
you I<ran> is the number of tests.  Until now, there was no way of asserting
that the number of tests you I<expected> is the number of tests unless you do
so before any tests have run.  This fixes that problem.

=head2 Environment variables

 DIE_ON_FAIL=1 prove t/
 BAIL_ON_FAIL=1 prove t/

If the C<DIE_ON_FAIL> or C<BAIL_ON_FAIL> environment variables are true, any
tests which use C<Test::Most> will throw an exception or call BAIL_OUT on test
failure.

=head1 RATIONALE

People want more control over their test suites.  Sometimes when you see
hundreds of tests failing and whizzing by, you want the test suite to simply
halt on the first failure.  This module gives you that control.

As for the reasons for the four test modules chosen, I ran code over a local
copy of the CPAN to find the most commonly used testing modules.  Here were
the top ten (out of 287):

 Test::More              44461
 Test                     8937
 Test::Exception          1379
 Test::Simple              731
 Test::Base                316
 Test::Builder::Tester     193
 Test::NoWarnings          174
 Test::Differences         146
 Test::MockObject          139
 Test::Deep                127

The four modules chosen seemed the best fit for what C<Test::Most> is trying
to do.  As of 0.02, we've added L<Test::Warn> by request.  It's not in the top
ten, but it's a great and useful module.

=head1 TODO

=head2 Deferred plans

Sometimes you don't know the number of tests you will run when you use
C<Test::More>.  The C<plan()> function allows you to delay specifying the
plan, but you must still call it before the tests are run.  This is an error:

 use Test::More;

 my $tests = 0;
 foreach my $test (
     my $count = run($test); # assumes tests are being run
     $tests += $count;
 }
 plan($tests);

The way around this is typically to use 'no_plan' and when the tests are done,
C<Test::Builder> merely sets the plan to the number of tests run.  We'd like
for the programmer to specify this number instead of letting C<Test::Builder>
do it.  However, C<Test::Builder> internals are a bit difficult to work with,
so we're delaying this feature.

=head2 Cleaner skip()

 if ( $some_condition ) {
     skip $message, $num_tests;
 }
 else {
     # run those tests
 }

That would be cleaner and I might add it if enough people want it.

=head1 CAVEATS

Because of how Perl handles arguments, and because diagnostics are not really
part of the Test Anything Protocol, what actually happens internally is that
we note that a test has failed and we throw an exception or bail out as soon
as the I<next> test is called (but before it runs).  This means that its
arguments are automatically evaulated before we can take action:

 use Test::Most qw<no_plan die>;

 ok $foo, 'Die if this fails';
 ok factorial(123456),
   '... but wait a loooong time before you throw an exception';

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Many thanks to C<perl-qa> for arguing about this so much that I just went
ahead and did it :)

Thanks to Aristotle for suggesting a better way to die or bailout.

Thanks to 'swillert' (L<http://use.perl.org/~swillert/>) for suggesting a
better implementation of my "dumper explain" idea
(L<http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/37004>).
