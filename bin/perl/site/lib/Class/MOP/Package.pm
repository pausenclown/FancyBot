=head1 NAME 

Class::MOP::Package - Package Meta Object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Package Protocol provides an abstraction of a Perl 5 package. A
package is basically namespace, and this module provides methods for
looking at and changing that namespace's symbol table.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<< Class::MOP::Package->initialize($package_name) >>

This method creates a new C<Class::MOP::Package> instance which
represents specified package. If an existing metaclass object exists
for the package, that will be returned instead.

=item B<< Class::MOP::Package->reinitialize($package) >>

This method forcibly removes any existing metaclass for the package
before calling C<initialize>. In contrast to C<initialize>, you may
also pass an existing C<Class::MOP::Package> instance instead of just
a package name as C<$package>.

Do not call this unless you know what you are doing.

=item B<< $metapackage->name >>

This is returns the package's name, as passed to the constructor.

=item B<< $metapackage->namespace >>

This returns a hash reference to the package's symbol table. The keys
are symbol names and the values are typeglob references.

=item B<< $metapackage->add_package_symbol($variable_name, $initial_value) >>

This method accepts a variable name and an optional initial value. The
C<$variable_name> must contain a leading sigil.

This method creates the variable in the package's symbol table, and
sets it to the initial value if one was provided.

=item B<< $metapackage->get_package_symbol($variable_name) >>

Given a variable name, this method returns the variable as a reference
or undef if it does not exist. The C<$variable_name> must contain a
leading sigil.

=item B<< $metapackage->has_package_symbol($variable_name) >>

Returns true if there is a package variable defined for
C<$variable_name>. The C<$variable_name> must contain a leading sigil.

=item B<< $metapackage->remove_package_symbol($variable_name) >>

This will remove the package variable specified C<$variable_name>. The
C<$variable_name> must contain a leading sigil.

=item B<< $metapackage->remove_package_glob($glob_name) >>

Given the name of a glob, this will remove that glob from the
package's symbol table. Glob names do not include a sigil. Removing
the glob removes all variables and subroutines with the specified
name.

=item B<< $metapackage->list_all_package_symbols($type_filter) >>

This will list all the glob names associated with the current
package. These names do not have leading sigils.

You can provide an optional type filter, which should be one of
'SCALAR', 'ARRAY', 'HASH', or 'CODE'.

=item B<< $metapackage->get_all_package_symbols($type_filter) >>

This works much like C<list_all_package_symbols>, but it returns a
hash reference. The keys are glob names and the values are references
to the value for that name.

=item B<< Class::MOP::Package->meta >>

This will return a L<Class::MOP::Class> instance for this class.
