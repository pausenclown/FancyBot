Win32::GUI::NotifyIcon - Create and manipulate icons and tooltips in the system tray

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functionality of Win32::GUI::NotifyIcon is affected by the version
of shell32.dll installed with the windows system running your script. You
can find this version from $Win32::GUI::NotifyIcon::SHELLDLL_VERSION,
which contains the major version number of the shell32.dll library that
has been loaded.

=head2 new

B<new(PARENT, %OPTIONS)>

Creates a new NotifyIcon (also known as system tray icon) object;
can also be called as PARENT->AddNotifyIcon(%OPTIONS).

B<%OPTIONS> are:

    -icon => Win32::GUI::Icon object
        the icon to display in the taskbar
    -name => STRING
        the name for the object
    -tip => STRING
        the text that will appear as a tooltip when the mouse is
        hovering over the NotifyIcon.  For shell32.dll versions prior
        to 5.0 the text length is limited to 63 characters;  For
        later versions it is limited to 127 characters.  The string
        provided will be truncated as necessary.
    -event => NEM Event Hash
       Set NEM event handler (you can also use -on Event Option).

For shell32.dll version 5.0 and later balloon tooltips can be used,
the following options control balloon tooltips.  If your version
of shell32.dll does not support balloon tooltips, then these options
are silently ignored:

    -balloon => 0/1
       A flag controlling whether the ballon tip is displayed by
       new() or Change(), or whether the ShowBalloon() method
       must be called to display the balloon tooltip.  Defaults
       to 0 (not displayed).
    -balloon_tip => STRING
       Sets the text that will appear in the body of the balloon tip.
       Will cause the balloon tip to be removed from the screen if set
       to the empty string and displayed. The string is limited to
       255 characters and will be truncated as necessary.
    -balloon_title => STRING
       Sets the text that appears as a title at the top of the balloon
       tip. The string is limited to 63 characters and will be truncated
       as necessary.
    -balloon_icon  => STRING
       Sets the icon that is displayed next to the balloon tip title. If
       the balloon tip title is not set (or is set to the empty string),
       then no icon is displayed.  Allowed values for STRING are:
       error, info, warning, none.  Defaults to 'none'.
   -balloon_timeout => NUMBER
       The maximum time for which a balloon tooltip is displayed before
       being removed, in milliseconds.  The system will limit the range
       allowed (typically to between 10 and 30 seconds).  If a balloon
       is being displayed and another taskbar icon tries to display a
       balloon tip, then the one being displayed will be removed after
       it has been displayed for the system minimum time (typically 10
       seconds), and only then will the new tooltip be displayed.
       Defaults to 10 seconds.

Returns a Win32::GUI::NotifyIcon object on success, undef on failure

See also the L<common options|Win32::GUI::Reference::Options>.

=head2 HideBalloon

B<HideBalloon([FLAG=1])>

Only supported by shell32.dll v5.0 and above

Show or hide a balloon tooltip with details supplied from the new() or
Change() methods, using the -balloon_tip, -balloon_title, -balloon_timeout
and -balloon_icon options.

Set B<FLAG> to a false value to display the balloon tooltip, or to a true
value to hide the tip (it will automatically be hidden by the system
after -balloon_timeout millseconds).  If B<FLAG> is omitted, hides the
tooltip.  If the tooltip is already showing, re-showing it queues
a new balloon tooltip to be displayed once the existing one times out.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure or undef if not supported.
