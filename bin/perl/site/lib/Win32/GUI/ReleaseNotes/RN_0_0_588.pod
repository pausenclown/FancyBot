=head1 Summary of Changes

This version solves various bugs, including:

  - memory leak
  - out of memory error with the -filter option in GetOpenFileName and
    GetSaveFileName
  - lot of warnings in Win32::GUI::Dialog

B<PLEASE NOTE:> I've made heavy changes in the internal working of
the module, so I'm not 100% sure that everything works fine. The good
news is that the module is a lot faster now :-) Please make
extensive tests, and report anything that used to work and doesn't
anymore.
