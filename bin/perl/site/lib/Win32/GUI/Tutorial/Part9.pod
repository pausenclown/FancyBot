=head2 What about that console window?

One thing I have glossed over in all of the above is precisely how we run our
Win32::GUI Perl program. There are a number of possibilities you might have
used.

=over

=item *

Enter the command "perl MyApp.pl" from a Windows console window.

=item *

Enter the command "perl MyApp.pl" in the Windows "Run" box.

=item *

Double click on the file "MyApp.pl" (assuming you have .pl files associated
with the perl.exe application).

=back

In the first case, you will notice that the command prompt does not return
until you close your GUI application's window. In the second and third case,
it's worse - a console window opens and stays visible until the GUI
application terminates.

This is ugly. Unfortunately, it's fairly inevitable, because of the way
Windows works. Perl itself is a Windows "console" application, and so it
behaves the way we see. You can't change this without changing Perl itself.

There is a fix for this, if you have Windows development tools available.
Simply take a copy of perl.exe, call it perlw.exe, and change its "subsystem"
setting from "console" to "windows". With Microsoft Visual Studio, the command
to do this is

    editbin /subsystem:windows perlw.exe

ActiveState Perl comes with an executable called wperl.exe (you'll find it
n the same place as your perl.exe).  This is an executable with exactly
this change already made to it.

If you can't (or don't want to) create a perlw.exe, then a compromise is to hide 
the console window while your application is running. This is reasonable for the 
second and third cases above, but less so for the first (where the application 
is run from an existing console window).

The code to do this is

    my ($DOS) = Win32::GUI::GetPerlWindow();
    Win32::GUI::Hide($DOS);

Note that C<GetPerlWindow()> returns a windows handle, not a C<Win32::GUI::Window>
object, so we have to use the static call to C<Win32::GUI::Hide()> as discussed
in part 1 of the tutorial.

Do this as early as possible. Obviously, if we hide the console, we must show
it when we finish (otherwise, someone who runs your program from a command
prompt will be B<very> cross with you!)

To do this, we need to put

    Win32::GUI::Show($DOS);

just before our program terminates. After the Win32::GUI::Dialog() call is
usually the right place.
