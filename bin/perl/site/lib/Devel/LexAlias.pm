=head1 NAME

Devel::LexAlias - alias lexical variables

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Devel::LexAlias qw(lexalias);

 sub steal_my_x {
     my $foo = 1;
     lexalias(1, '$x', \$foo);
 }

 sub foo {
     my $x = 22;
     print $x; # prints 22

     steal_my_x;
     print $x; # prints 1
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::LexAlias provides the ability to alias a lexical variable in a
subroutines scope to one of your choosing.

If you don't know why you'd want to do this, I'd suggest that you skip
this module.  If you think you have a use for it, I'd insist on it.

Still here?

=over

=item lexalias( $where, $name, $variable )

C<$where> refers to the subroutine in which to alias the lexical, it
can be a coderef or a call level such that you'd give to C<caller>

C<$name> is the name of the lexical within that subroutine

C<$variable> is a reference to the variable to install at that location

=head1 BUGS

lexalias delves into the internals of the interpreter to perform its
actions and is so very sensitive to bad data, which will likely result
in flaming death, or a core dump.  Consider this a warning.

There is no checking that you are attaching a suitable variable back
into the pad as implied by the name of the variable, so it is possible
to do the following:

 lexalias( $sub, '$foo', [qw(an array)] );

The behaviour of this is untested, I imagine badness is very close on
the horizon though.
