=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Data Types

=over

=item i_img

This is Imager's image type.

It contains the following members:

=over

=item *

channels - the number of channels in the image

=item *

xsize, ysize - the width and height of the image in pixels

=item *

bytes - the number of bytes used to store the image data.  Undefined
where virtual is non-zero.

=item *

ch_mask - a mask of writable channels.  eg. if this is 6 then only
channels 1 and 2 are writable.  There may be bits set for which there
are no channels in the image.

=item *

bits - the number of bits stored per sample.  Should be one of
i_8_bits, i_16_bits, i_double_bits.

=item *

type - either i_direct_type for direct color images, or i_palette_type
for paletted images.

=item *

virtual - if zero then this image is-self contained.  If non-zero then
this image could be an interface to some other implementation.

=item *

idata - the image data.  This should not be directly accessed.  A new
image implementation can use this to store its image data.
i_img_destroy() will myfree() this pointer if it's non-null.

=item *

tags - a structure storing the image's tags.  This should only be
accessed via the i_tags_*() functions.

=item *

ext_data - a pointer for use internal to an image implementation.
This should be freed by the image's destroy handler.

=item *

im_data - data internal to Imager.  This is initialized by
i_img_init().

=item *

i_f_ppix, i_f_ppixf, i_f_plin, i_f_plinf, i_f_gpix, i_f_gpixf,
i_f_glin, i_f_glinf, i_f_gsamp, i_f_gampf - implementations for each
of the required image functions.  An image implementation should
initialize these between calling i_img_alloc() and i_img_init().

=item *

i_f_gpal, i_f_ppal, i_f_addcolors, i_f_getcolors, i_f_colorcount,
i_f_maxcolors, i_f_findcolor, i_f_setcolors - implementations for each
paletted image function.

=item *

i_f_destroy - custom image destruction function.  This should be used
to release memory if necessary.

=item *

i_f_gsamp_bits - implements i_gsamp_bits() for this image.

=item *

i_f_psamp_bits - implements i_psamp_bits() for this image.

=item i_color

Type for 8-bit/sample color.

Samples as per;

  i_color c;

i_color is a union of:

=over

=item *

gray - contains a single element gray_color, eg. c.gray.gray_color

=item *

rgb - contains three elements r, g, b, eg. c.rgb.r

=item *

rgba - contains four elements r, g, b, a, eg. c.rgba.a

=item *

cmyk - contains four elements c, m, y, k, eg. C<c.cmyk.y>.  Note that
Imager never uses CMYK colors except when reading/writing files.

=item *

channels - an array of four channels, eg C<c.channels[2]>.

This is the double/sample color type.

Its layout exactly corresponds to i_color.


=for comment
From: File imdatatypes.h

=item i_fill_t

=item i_maxcolors(im)


Returns the maximum number of colors the palette can hold for the
image.

Returns -1 for direct color images.

=item i_setcolors(im, index, colors, count)


Sets I<count> colors starting from I<index> in the image's palette.

On sucess returns true.

On failure returns false.

The image must have at least I<index>+I<count> colors in it's palette
for this to succeed.

=item i_tags_delbycode(tags, code)


Delete any tags with the given code.

Returns the number of tags deleted.


=for comment

=item i_tags_delbyname(tags, name)


Delete any tags with the given name.

Returns the number of tags deleted.


=for comment

=item i_tags_delete(tags, index)


Delete a tag by index.

Returns true on success.

=item i_tags_destroy(tags)


Destroys the given tags structure.  Called by i_img_destroy().


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_find(tags, name, start, &entry)


Searchs for a tag of the given I<name> starting from index I<start>.

On success returns true and sets *I<entry>.

On failure returns false.


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_findn(tags, code, start, &entry)


Searchs for a tag of the given I<code> starting from index I<start>.

On success returns true and sets *I<entry>.

On failure returns false.


=for comment

=item i_tags_get_color(tags, name, code, &value)


Retrieve a tag specified by name or code as color.

On success sets the i_color *I<value> to the color and returns true.

On failure returns false.


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_get_float(tags, name, code, value)


Retrieves a tag as a floating point value.  

If the tag has a string value then that is parsed as a floating point
number, otherwise the integer value of the tag is used.

On success sets *I<value> and returns true.

On failure returns false.


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_get_int(tags, name, code, &value)


Retrieve a tag specified by name or code as an integer.

On success sets the int *I<value> to the integer and returns true.

On failure returns false.


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_get_string(tags, name, code, value, value_size)


Retrieves a tag by name or code as a string.

On success copies the string to value for a max of value_size and
returns true.

On failure returns false.

value_size must be at least large enough for a string representation
of an integer.

The copied value is always NUL terminated.

=item i_tags_new(i_img_tags *tags)


Initialize a tags structure.  Should not be used if the tags structure
has been previously used.

This should be called tags member of an i_img object on creation (in
i_img_*_new() functions).

To destroy the contents use i_tags_destroy()


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_set(tags, name, data, size)

Sets the given tag to the string I<data>

If size is -1 then the strlen(I<data>) bytes are stored.

Even on failure, if an existing tag I<name> exists, it will be
removed.


=for comment

=item i_tags_set_color(tags, name, code, &value)


Stores the given color as a tag with the given name and code.

=item i_tags_set_float(tags, name, code, value)


Equivalent to i_tags_set_float2(tags, name, code, value, 30).


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_set_float2(tags, name, code, value, places)


Sets the tag with the given name and code to the given floating point
value.

Since tags are strings or ints, we convert the value to a string before
storage at the precision specified by C<places>.


=for comment
From: File tags.c

=item i_tags_setn(tags, name, idata)

Sets the given tag to the integer I<idata>

Even on failure, if an existing tag I<name> exists, it will be
removed.
