=head1 NAME

DBD::ODBC - ODBC Driver for DBI

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to DBD::ODBC version 1.22_2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBI;

  $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:ODBC:DSN', 'user', 'password');

See L<DBI> for more information.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Change log and FAQs

Please note that the change log has been moved to
DBD::ODBC::Changes. To access this documentation, use
C<perldoc DBD::ODBC::Changes>.

The FAQs have also moved to DBD::ODBC::FAQ.pm. To access the FAQs use
C<perldoc DBD::ODBC::FAQ>.

=head2 Important note about the tests

Please note that some tests may fail or report they are unsupported on
this platform.  Notably Oracle's ODBC driver will fail the "advanced"
binding tests in t/08bind2.t.  These tests run perfectly under SQL
Server 2000. This is normal and expected.  Until Oracle fixes their
drivers to do the right thing from an ODBC perspective, it's going to
be tough to fix the issue.  The workaround for Oracle is to bind date
types with SQL_TIMESTAMP.  Also note that some tests may be skipped,
such as t/09multi.t, if your driver doesn't seem to support returning
multiple result sets.  This is normal.

=head2 Version Control

DBD::ODBC source code is under version control at svn.perl.org.  If
you would like to use the "bleeding" edge version, you can get the
latest from svn.perl.org via Subversion version control.  Note there
is no guarantee that this version is any different than what you get
from the tarball from CPAN, but it might be :)

You may read about Subversion at L<http://subversion.tigris.org>

You can get a subversion client from there and check dbd-odbc out via:

   svn checkout http://svn.perl.org/modules/dbd-odbc/trunk <your directory name here>

Which will pull all the files from the subversion trunk to your
specified directory. If you want to see what has changed since the
last release of DBD::ODBC read the Changes file or use "svn log" to
get a list of checked in changes.

=head2 Contributing

There are six main ways you may help with the development and
maintenance of this module:

=over

=item Submitting patches

Please use Subversion (see above) to get the latest version of
DBD::ODBC from the trunk and submit any patches against that.

Please, before submitting a patch:

   svn update
   <try and included a test which demonstrates the fix/change working>
   <test your patch>
   svn diff > describe_my_diffs.patch

and send the resulting file to me and cc the dbi-users@perl.org
mailing list (if you are not a member - why not!).

=item Reporting installs

Install CPAN::Reporter and report you installations. This is easy to
do - see L</CPAN Testers Reporting>.

=item Report bugs

If you find what you believe is a bug then enter it into the
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=DBD-ODBC> system. Where
possible include code which reproduces the problem including any
schema required and the versions of software you are using.

If you are unsure whether you have found a bug report it anyway or
post it to the dbi-users mailing list.

=item pod comments and corrections

If you find inaccuracies in the DBD::ODBC pod or have a comment which
you think should be added then go to L<http://annocpan.org> and submit
them there. I get an email for every comment added and will review
each one and apply any changes to the documentation.

=item submit test cases

Most DBDs are built against a single client library for the database.

Unlike other DBDs, DBD::ODBC works with many different ODBC drivers.
Although they all should be written with regard to the ODBC
specification drivers have bugs and in some places the specification is
open to interpretation. As a result, when changes are applied to
DBD::ODBC it is very easy to break something in one ODBC driver.

What helps enormously to identify problems in the many combinations
of DBD::ODBC and ODBC drivers is a large test suite. I would greatly
appreciate any test cases and in particular any new test cases for
databases other than MS SQL Server.

=head2 DBI attribute handling

If a DBI defined attribute is not mentioned here it behaves as per the
DBI specification.

=head3 ReadOnly (boolean)

DBI documents the C<ReadOnly> attribute as being settleable and
retrievable on connection and statement handles. In ODBC setting
ReadOnly to true causes the connection attribute C<SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE>
to be set to C<SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY> and setting it to false will set the
access mode to C<SQL_MODE_READ_WRITE> (which is the default in ODBC).

B<Note:> There is no equivalent of setting ReadOnly on a statement
handle in ODBC.

B<Note:> See ODBC documentation on C<SQL_ATTR_ACCESS_MODE> as setting it
to C<SQL_MODE_READ_ONLY> does B<not> prevent your script from running
updates or deletes; it is simply a hint to the driver/database that
you won't being doing updates.

This attribute requires DBI version 1.55 or better.

=head2 Private attributes common to connection and statement handles

=head3 odbc_ignore_named_placeholders

Use this if you have special needs (such as Oracle triggers, etc)
where :new or :name mean something special and are not just place
holder names. You I<must> then use ? for binding parameters.  Example:

 $dbh->{odbc_ignore_named_placeholders} = 1;
 $dbh->do("create trigger foo as if :new.x <> :old.x then ... etc");

Without this, DBD::ODBC will think :new and :old are placeholders for
binding and get confused.

=head3 odbc_default_bind_type

This value defaults to 0.

Older versions of DBD::ODBC assumed that the parameter binding type
was 12 (C<SQL_VARCHAR>).  Newer versions always attempt to call
C<SQLDescribeParam> to find the parameter types but if
C<SQLDescribeParam> is unavailable DBD::ODBC falls back to a default
bind type. The internal default bind type is C<SQL_VARCHAR> (for
non-unicode build) and C<SQL_WVARCHAR> (for a unicode build). If you
set C<odbc_default_bind_type> to a value other than 0 you override the
internal default.

B<N.B> If you call the C<bind_param> method with a SQL type this
overrides everything else above.

=head3 odbc_force_rebind

This is to handle special cases, especially when using multiple result sets.
Set this before execute to "force" DBD::ODBC to re-obtain the result set's
number of columns and column types for each execute.  Especially useful for
calling stored procedures which may return different result sets each
execute.  The only performance penalty is during execute(), but I didn't
want to incur that penalty for all circumstances.  It is probably fairly
rare that this occurs.  This attribute will be automatically set when
multiple result sets are triggered.  Most people shouldn't have to worry
about this.

=head3 odbc_async_exec

Allow asynchronous execution of queries.  This causes a spin-loop
(with a small "sleep") until the ODBC API being called is complete
(i.e., while the ODBC API returns C<SQL_STILL_EXECUTING>).  This is
useful, however, if you want the error handling and asynchronous
messages (see the L</odbc_err_handler> and F<t/20SQLServer.t> for an
example of this.

=head3 odbc_query_timeout

This allows you to change the ODBC query timeout (the ODBC statement
attribute C<SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT>). ODBC defines the query time out as
the number of seconds to wait for a SQL statement to execute before
returning to the application. A value of 0 (the default) means there
is no time out. Do not confuse this with the ODBC attributes
C<SQL_ATTR_LOGIN_TIMEOUT> and C<SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT>. Add

  { odbc_query_timeout => 30 }

to your connect, set on the C<dbh> before creating a statement or
explicitly set it on your statement handle. The odbc_query_timeout on
a statement is inherited from the parent connection.

Note that internally DBD::ODBC only sets the query timeout if you set it
explicitly and the default of 0 (no time out) is implemented by the
ODBC driver and not DBD::ODBC.

Note that some ODBC drivers implement a maximum query timeout value
and will limit timeouts set above their maximum. You may see a
warning if your time out is capped by the driver but there is
currently no way to retrieve the capped value back from the driver.

Note that some drivers may not support this attribute.

See F<t/20SqlServer.t> for an example.

=head3 odbc_putdata_start

C<odbc_putdata_start> defines the size at which DBD::ODBC uses
C<SQLPutData> and C<SQLParamData> to send larger objects to the
database instead of simply binding them as normal with
C<SQLBindParameter>. It is mostly a placeholder for future changes
allowing chunks of data to be sent to the database and there is little
reason for anyone to change it currently.

The default for odbc_putdata_start is 32768 because this value was
hard-coded in DBD::ODBC until 1.16_1.

=head3 odbc_column_display_size

If you ODBC driver does not support the SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE and
SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH attributes to SQLColAtrributes then DBD::ODBC does
not know how big the column might be. odbc_column_display_size sets
the default value for the column size when retrieving column data
where the size cannot be determined.

The default for odbc_column_display_size is 2001 because this value was
hard-coded in DBD::ODBC until 1.17_3.

=head2 Private connection attributes

=head3 odbc_err_handler

B<NOTE:> There should be no reason to use this now as there is a DBI
attribute of a similar name. In future versions this attribute will
be deleted.

Allow errors to be handled by the application.  A call-back function
supplied by the application to handle or ignore messages.

The callback function receives three parameters: state (string),
error (string) and the native error code (number).

If the error handler returns 0, the error is ignored, otherwise the
error is passed through the normal DBI error handling.

This can also be used for procedures under MS SQL Server (Sybase too,
probably) to obtain messages from system procedures such as DBCC.
Check F<t/20SQLServer.t> and F<t/10handler.t>.

  $dbh->{RaiseError} = 1;
  sub err_handler {
     ($state, $msg, $native) = @_;
     if ($state = '12345')
         return 0; # ignore this error
     else
         return 1; # propagate error
  }
  $dbh->{odbc_err_handler} = \$err_handler;
  # do something to cause an error
  $dbh->{odbc_err_handler} = undef; # cancel the handler

=head3 odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE

Here is the information from the original patch, however, this
could/has caused SQL Server to "lock up".  Please use at your own
risk!

C<SQL_ROWSET_SIZE> attribute patch from Andrew Brown

  > There are only 2 additional lines allowing for the setting of
  > SQL_ROWSET_SIZE as db handle option.
  >
  > The purpose to my madness is simple. SqlServer (7 anyway) by default
  > supports only one select statement at once (using standard ODBC cursors).
  > According to the SqlServer documentation you can alter the default

  >
  > Andrew
  >

In versions of SQL Server 2008 and later see "Multiple Active
Statements (MAS)" in the DBD::ODBC::FAQ instead of using this
attribute.

=head3 odbc_exec_direct

Force DBD::ODBC to use C<SQLExecDirect> instead of
C<SQLPrepare>/C<SQLExecute>.

There are drivers that only support C<SQLExecDirect> and the DBD::ODBC
do() override does not allow returning result sets.  Therefore, the
way to do this now is to set the attribute odbc_exec_direct.

NOTE: You may also want to use this option if you are creating
temporary objects (e.g., tables) in MS SQL Server and for some
reason cannot use the C<do> method. see
L<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/ms131667.aspx> which says
I<Prepared statements cannot be used to create temporary objects on
SQL Server 2000 or later...>. Without odbc_exec_direct, the temporary
object will disappear before you can use it.

There are currently two ways to get this:

    $dbh->prepare($sql, { odbc_exec_direct => 1});

and

    $dbh->{odbc_exec_direct} = 1;

B<NOTE:> Even if you build DBD::ODBC with unicode support you can
still not pass unicode strings to the prepare method if you also set
odbc_exec_direct. This is a restriction in this attribute which is
unavoidable.

=head3 SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER

This, while available via get_info() is captured here.  I may get rid
of this as I only used it for debugging purposes.

=head3 odbc_cursortype

This allows multiple concurrent statements on SQL*Server.  In your
connect, add

  { odbc_cursortype => 2 }.

If you are using DBI > 1.41, you should also be able to use

 { odbc_cursortype => DBI::SQL_CURSOR_DYNAMIC }

instead.  For example:

    my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", $user, $pass,
                  { RaiseError => 1, odbc_cursortype => 2});
    my $sth = $dbh->prepare("one statement");
    my $sth2 = $dbh->prepare("two statement");
    $sth->execute;
    my @row;
    while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array) {
       $sth2->execute($row[0]);
    }

See F<t/20SqlServer.t> for an example.

=head3 odbc_has_unicode

A read-only attribute signifying whether DBD::ODBC was built with the
C macro WITH_UNICODE or not. A value of 1 indicates DBD::ODBC was built
with WITH_UNICODE else the value returned is 0.

Building WITH_UNICODE affects columns and parameters which are
SQL_C_WCHAR, SQL_WCHAR, SQL_WVARCHAR, and SQL_WLONGVARCHAR, SQL,
the connect method and a lot more. See L</Unicode>.

When odbc_has_unicode is 1, DBD::ODBC will:

=over

=item bind columns the database declares as wide characters as SQL_Wxxx

This means that UNICODE data stored in these columns will be returned
to Perl in UTF-8 and with the UTF8 flag set.

=item bind parameters the database declares as wide characters as SQL_Wxxx

Parameters bound where the database declares the parameter as being
a wide character (or where the parameter type is explicitly set to a
wide type - SQL_Wxxx) can be UTF8 in Perl and will be mapped to UTF16
before passing to the driver.

=item SQL

SQL passed to the C<prepare> or C<do> methods which has the UTF8 flag set
will be converted to UTF16 before being passed to the ODBC APIs C<SQLPrepare>
or C<SQLExecDirect>.

=item connection strings

Connection strings passed to the C<connect> method will be converted
to UTF16 before being passed to the ODBC API C<SQLDriverConnectW>. This happens
irrespective of whether the UTF8 flag is set on the perl connect strings
because unixODBC requires an application to call SQLDriverConnectW to indicate
it will be calling the wide ODBC APIs.

=back

NOTE: You will need at least Perl 5.8.1 to use UNICODE with DBD::ODBC.

NOTE: Binding of unicode output parameters is coded but untested.

NOTE: When building DBD::ODBC on Windows ($^O eq 'MSWin32') the
WITH_UNICODE macro is automatically added. To disable specify -nou as
an argument to Makefile.PL (e.g. C<perl Makefile.PL -nou>). On non-Windows
platforms the WITH_UNICODE macro is B<not> enabled by default and to enable
you need to specify the -u argument to Makefile.PL. Please bare in mind
that some ODBC drivers do not support SQL_Wxxx columns or parameters.

NOTE: Unicode support on Windows 64 bit platforms is currently
untested.  Let me know how you get on with it.

UNICODE support in ODBC Drivers differs considerably. Please read the
README.unicode file for further details.

=head3 odbc_out_connect_string

After calling the connect method this will be the ODBC driver's
out connection string - see documentation on SQLDriverConnect.

=head3 odbc_version

This was added prior to the move to ODBC 3.x to allow the caller to
"force" ODBC 3.0 compatibility.  It's probably not as useful now, but
it allowed get_info and get_type_info to return correct/updated
information that ODBC 2.x didn't permit/provide.  Since DBD::ODBC is
now 3.x, this can be used to force 2.x behavior via something like: my

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:ODBC:$DSN", $user, $pass,
                      { odbc_version =>2});

=head2 Private statement attributes

=head3 odbc_more_results

Use this attribute to determine if there are more result sets
available.  SQL Server supports this feature.  Use this as follows:

  do {
     my @row;
     while (@row = $sth->fetchrow_array()) {
        # do stuff here
     }
  } while ($sth->{odbc_more_results});

Note that with multiple result sets and output parameters (i.e,. using
bind_param_inout, don't expect output parameters to be bound until ALL
result sets have been retrieved.

=head2 Private DBD::ODBC Functions

You use DBD::ODBC private functions like this:

  $dbh->func(arg, private_function_name, @args);

=head3 GetInfo

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's get_info method.>

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetInfo call and the argument
should be a valid ODBC information type (see ODBC specification).
e.g.

  $value = $dbh->func(6, 'GetInfo');

which returns the C<SQL_DRIVER_NAME>.

This function returns a scalar value, which can be a numeric or string
value depending on the information value requested.

=head3 SQLGetTypeInfo

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's type_info and
type_info_all methods.>

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetTypeInfo API and the argument
should be a SQL type number (e.g. SQL_VARCHAR) or
SQL_ALL_TYPES. SQLGetTypeInfo returns information about a data type
supported by the data source.

e.g.

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);

  $sth = $dbh->func(SQL_ALL_TYPES, GetTypeInfo);
  DBI::dump_results($sth);

This function returns a DBI statement handle for the SQLGetTypeInfo
result-set containing many columns of type attributes (see ODBC
specification).

NOTE: It is VERY important that the C<use DBI> includes the
C<qw(:sql_types)> so that values like SQL_VARCHAR are correctly
interpreted.  This "imports" the sql type names into the program's
name space.  A very common mistake is to forget the C<qw(:sql_types)>
and obtain strange results.

=head3 GetFunctions

This function maps to the ODBC SQLGetFunctions API which returns
information on whether a function is supported by the ODBC driver.

The argument should be C<SQL_API_ALL_FUNCTIONS> (0) for all functions
or a valid ODBC function number (e.g. C<SQL_API_SQLDESCRIBEPARAM>
which is 58). See ODBC specification or examine your sqlext.h and
sql.h header files for all the SQL_API_XXX macros.

If called with C<SQL_API_ALL_FUNCTIONS> (0), then a 100 element array is
returned where each element will contain a '1' if the ODBC function with
that SQL_API_XXX index is supported or '' if it is not.

If called with a specific SQL_API_XXX value for a single function it will
return true if the ODBC driver supports that function, otherwise false.

e.g.


    my @x = $dbh->func(0,"GetFunctions");
    print "SQLDescribeParam is supported\n" if ($x[58]);

or

    print "SQLDescribeParam is supported\n"
        if $dbh->func(58, "GetFunctions");

=head3 GetStatistics

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statistics_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLStatistics API.
You call SQLStatistics like this:

  $dbh->func($catalog, $schema, $table, $unique, 'GetStatistics');

Prior to DBD::ODBC 1.16 $unique was not defined as being true/false or
SQL_INDEX_UNIQUE/SQL_INDEX_ALL. In fact, whatever value you provided
for $unique was passed through to the ODBC API SQLStatistics call
unchanged. This changed in 1.16, where $unique became a true/false
value which is interpreted into SQL_INDEX_UNIQUE for true and
SQL_INDEX_ALL for false.

=head3 GetForeignKeys

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's foreign_key_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLForeignKeys API.
You call SQLForeignKeys like this:

  $dbh->func($pcatalog, $pschema, $ptable,
             $fcatalog, $fschema, $ftable,
             "GetForeignKeys");

=head3 GetPrimaryKeys

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's primary_key_info
method.>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLPrimaryKeys API.
You call SQLPrimaryKeys like this:

  $dbh->func($catalog, $schema, $table, "GetPrimaryKeys");

=head3 data_sources

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's data_sources
method.>

You call data_sources like this:

  @dsns = $dbh->func("data_sources);

Handled since 0.21.

=head3 GetSpecialColumns

See the ODBC specification for the SQLSpecialColumns API.
You call SQLSpecialColumns like this:

  $dbh->func($identifier, $catalog, $schema, $table, $scope,
             $nullable, 'GetSpecialColumns');

Handled as of version 0.28

head3 ColAttributes

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statement attributes
NAME, TYPE, PRECISION, SCALE, NULLABLE etc).>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLColAttributes API.
You call SQLColAttributes like this:

  $dbh->func($column, $ftype, "ColAttributes");

  SQL_COLUMN_COUNT = 0
  SQL_COLUMN_NAME = 1
  SQL_COLUMN_TYPE = 2
  SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH = 3
  SQL_COLUMN_PRECISION = 4
  SQL_COLUMN_SCALE = 5
  SQL_COLUMN_DISPLAY_SIZE = 6
  SQL_COLUMN_NULLABLE = 7
  SQL_COLUMN_UNSIGNED = 8
  SQL_COLUMN_MONEY = 9
  SQL_COLUMN_UPDATABLE = 10
  SQL_COLUMN_AUTO_INCREMENT = 11
  SQL_COLUMN_CASE_SENSITIVE = 12
  SQL_COLUMN_SEARCHABLE = 13
  SQL_COLUMN_TYPE_NAME = 14
  SQL_COLUMN_TABLE_NAME = 15
  SQL_COLUMN_OWNER_NAME = 16
  SQL_COLUMN_QUALIFIER_NAME = 17
  SQL_COLUMN_LABEL = 18

B<Note:>Oracle's ODBC driver for linux in instant client 11r1 often
returns strange values for column name e.g., '20291'. It is wiser to
use DBI's NAME and NAME_xx attributes for portability.


head3 DescribeCol

B<This private function is now superceded by DBI's statement attributes
NAME, TYPE, PRECISION, SCLARE, NULLABLE etc).>

See the ODBC specification for the SQLDescribeCol API.
You call SQLDescribeCol like this:

  @info = $dbh->func($column, "DescribeCol");

The returned array contains the column attributes in the order described
in the ODBC specification for SQLDescribeCol.

=head2 Tracing

DBD::ODBC now supports the parse_trace_flag and parse_trace_flags
methods introduced in DBI 1.42 (see DBI for a full description).  As
of DBI 1.604, the only trace flag defined which is relevant to
DBD::ODBC is 'SQL' which DBD::ODBC supports by outputting the SQL
strings (after modification) passed to the prepare and do methods.

Currently DBD::ODBC supports two private trace flags. The
'odbcunicode' flag traces some unicode operations and the
odbcconnection traces the connect process.

To enable tracing of particular flags you use:

  $h->trace($h->parse_trace_flags('SQL|odbcconnection'));
  $h->trace($h->parse_trace_flags('1|odbcunicode'));

In the first case 'SQL' and 'odbcconnection' tracing is enabled on
$h. In the second case trace level 1 is set and 'odbcunicode' tracing
is enabled.

If you want to enable a DBD::ODBC private trace flag before connecting
you need to do something like:

  use DBD::ODBC;
  DBI->trace(DBD::ODBC->parse_trace_flag('odbcconnection'));

or

  use DBD::ODBC;
  DBI->trace(DBD::ODBC->parse_trace_flags('odbcconnection|odbcunicode'));

DBD::ODBC outputs tracing at levels 3 and above (as levels 1 and 2 are
reserved for DBI).

For comprehensive tracing of DBI method calls without all the DBI
internals see L<DBIx::Log4perl>.

=head2 Deviations from the DBI specification

=head3 Mixed placeholder types

There are 3 conventions for place holders in DBI. These are '?', ':N'
and ':name' (where 'N' is a number and 'name' is an alpha numeric
string not beginning with a number). DBD::ODBC supports all these methods
for naming placeholders but you must only use one method throughout
a particular SQL string. If you mix placeholder methods you will get
an error like:

  Can't mix placeholder styles (1/2)

=head3 Using the same placeholder more than once

DBD::ODBC does not support (currently) the use of one named placeholder
more than once in the a single SQL string. i.e.,

  insert into foo values (:bar, :p1, :p2, :bar);

is not supported because 'bar' is used more than once but:

  insert into foo values(:bar, :p1, :p2)

is ok. If you do the former you will get an error like:

  DBD::ODBC does not yet support binding a named parameter more than once

=head3 Binding named placeholders

Although the DBI documentation (as of 1.604) does not say how named
parameters are bound Tim Bunce has said that in Oracle they are bound
with the leading ':' as part of the name and that has always been the
case. i.e.,

  prepare("insert into mytable values (:fred)");
  bind_param(":foo", 1);

DBD::ODBC does not support binding named parameters with the ':' introducer.
In the above example you must use:

  bind_param("foo", 1);

In discussion on the dbi-dev list is was suggested that the ':' could
be made optional and there were no basic objections but it has not
made it's way into the pod yet.

=head3 Sticky Parameter Types

The DBI specification post 1.608 says in bind_param:

  The data type is 'sticky' in that bind values passed to execute()
  are bound with the data type specified by earlier bind_param()
  calls, if any.  Portable applications should not rely on being able
  to change the data type after the first C<bind_param> call.

DBD::ODBC does allow a parameter to be rebound with another data type as
ODBC inherently allows this. Therefore you can do:

  # parameter 1 set as a SQL_LONGVARCHAR
  $sth->bind_param(1, $data, DBI::SQL_LONGVARCHAR);
  # without the bind above the $data parameter would be either a DBD::ODBC
  # internal default or whatever the ODBC driver said it was but because
  # parameter types are sticky, the type is still SQL_LONGVARCHAR.
  $sth->execute($data);
  # change the bound type to SQL_VARCHAR
  # some DBDs will ignore the type in the following, DBD::ODBC does not
  $sth->bind_param(1, $data, DBI::SQL_VARCHAR);


=head2 Unicode

The ODBC specification supports wide character versions (a postfix of
'W') of some of the normal ODBC APIs e.g., SQLDriverConnectW is a wide
character version of SQLDriverConnect.

In ODBC on Windows the wide characters are defined as SQLWCHARs (2
bytes) and are UCS-2. On non-Windows, the main driver managers I know
of have implemented the wide character APIs differently:

=over

=item unixODBC

unixODBC mimics the Windows ODBC API precisely meaning the wide
character versions expect and return 2-byte characters in
UCS-2.

unixODBC will happily recognise ODBC drivers which only have the ANSI
versions of the ODBC API and those that have the wide versions
too.

unixODBC will allow an ANSI application to work with a unicode
ODBC driver and vice versa (although in the latter case you obviously
cannot actually use unicode).

unixODBC does not prevent you sending UTF-8 in the ANSI versions of
the ODBC APIs but whether that is understood by your ODBC driver is
another matter.

unixODBC differs in only one way from the Microsoft ODBC driver in
terms of unicode support in that it avoids unnecessary translations
between single byte and double byte characters when an ANSI
application is using a unicode-aware ODBC driver by requiring unicode
applications to signal their intent by calling SQLDriverConnectW
first. On Windows, the ODBC driver manager always uses the wide
versions of the ODBC API in ODBC drivers which provide the wide
versions regardless of what the application really needs and this
results in a lot of unnecessary character translations when you have
an ANSI application and a unicode ODBC driver.

=item iODBC

The wide character versions expect and return wchar_t types.

=back

DBD::ODBC has gone with unixODBC so you cannot use iODBC with a
unicode build of DBD::ODBC. However, some ODBC drivers support UTF-8
(although how they do this with SQLGetData reliably I don't know)
and so you should be able to use those with DBD::ODBC not built for
unicode.

=head3 Enabling and Disabling Unicode support

On Windows Unicode support as ss enabled by default and to disable it
you will need to specify C<-nou> to F<Makefile.PL> to get back to the
original behavior of DBD::ODBC before any Unicode support was added.

e.g.,

  perl Makfile.PL -nou

On non-Windows platforms Unicode support is disabled by default. To
enable it specify C<-u> to F<Makefile.PL> when you configure DBD::ODBC.

e.g.,

  perl Makefile.PL -u

=head3 Unicode - What is supported?

As of version 1.17 DBD::ODBC has the following unicode support:

=over

=item SQL (introduced in 1.16_2)

Unicode strings in calls to the C<prepare> and C<do> methods are
supported so long as the C<odbc_execdirect> attribute is not used.

=item unicode connection strings (introduced in 1.16_2)

Unicode connection strings are supported but you will need a DBI
post 1.607 for that.

=item column names

Unicode column names are returned.

=item bound columns (introduced in 1.15)

If the DBMS reports the column as being a wide character (SQL_Wxxx) it
will be bound as a wide character and any returned data will be
converted from UTF16 to UTF8 and the UTF8 flag will then be set on the
data.

=item bound parameters

If the perl scalars you bind to parameters are marked UTF8 and the
DBMS reports the type as being a wide type or you bind the parameter
as a wide type they will be converted to wide characters and bound as
such.

=back

Since version 1.16_4, the default parameter bind type is SQL_WVARCHAR
for unicode builds of DBD::ODBC. This only affects ODBC drivers which
do not support SQLDescribeParam and only then if you do not
specifically set a sql type on the bind_param method call.

The above Unicode support has been tested with the SQL Server, Oracle
9.2+ and Postgres drivers on Windows and various Easysoft ODBC drivers
on UNIX.

=head3 Unicode - What is not supported?

You cannot use unicode parameter names e.g.,

  select * from table where column = :unicode_param_name

You cannot use unicode strings in calls to prepare if you set the
odbc_execdirect attribute.

You cannot use the iODBC driver manager with DBD::ODBC built for
unicode.

=head3 Unicode - Caveats

For Unicode support on any platform in Perl you will need at least
Perl 5.8.1 - sorry but this is the way it is with Perl.

The Unicode support in DBD::ODBC expects a WCHAR to be 2 bytes (as it
is on Windows and as the ODBC specification suggests it is). Until
ODBC specifies any other Unicode support it is not envisioned this
will change.  On UNIX there are a few different ODBC driver
managers. I have only tested the unixODBC driver manager
(http://www.unixodbc.org) with Unicode support and it was built with
defaults which set WCHAR as 2 bytes.

I believe that the iODBC driver manager expects wide characters to be
wchar_t types (which are usually 4) and hence DBD::ODBC will not work
iODBC when built for unicode.

The ODBC Driver must expect Unicode data specified in SQLBindParameter
and SQLBindCol to be UTF16 in local endianess. Similarly, in calls to
SQLPrepareW, SQLDescribeColW and SQLDriverConnectW.

You should be aware that once Unicode support is enabled it affects a
number of DBI methods (some of which you might not expect). For
instance, when listing tables, columns etc some drivers
(e.g. Microsoft SQL Server) will report the column types as wide types
even if the strings actually fit in 7-bit ASCII. As a result, there is
an overhead for retrieving this column data as 2 bytes per character
will be transmitted (compared with 1 when Unicode support is not
enabled) and these strings will be converted into UTF8 but will end up
fitting (in most cases) into 7bit ASCII so a lot of conversion work
has been performed for nothing. If you don't have Unicode table and
column names or Unicode column data in your tables you are best
disabling Unicode support.

I am at present unsure if ChopBlanks processing on Unicode strings is
working correctly on UNIX. If nothing else the construct L' ' in
dbdimp.c might not work with all UNIX compilers. Reports of issues and
patches welcome.

=head3 Unicode implementation in DBD::ODBC

DBD::ODBC uses the wide character versions of the ODBC API and the
SQL_WCHAR ODBC type to support unicode in Perl.

Wide characters returned from the ODBC driver will be converted to
UTF-8 and the perl scalars will have the utf8 flag set (by using
sv_utf8_decode).

perl scalars which are UTF-8 and are sent through the ODBC API will be
converted to UTF-16 and passed to the ODBC wide APIs or signalled as
SQL_WCHARs (e.g., in the case of bound columns).

When built for unicode, DBD::ODBC will always call SQLDriverConnectW
(and not SQLDriverConnect) even if a) your connection string is not
unicode b) you have not got a DBI later than 1.607, because unixODBC
requires SQLDriverConnectW to be called if you want to call other
unicode ODBC APIs later. As a result, if you build for unicode and
pass ASCII strings to the connect method they will be converted to
UTF-16 and passed to SQLDriverConnectW. This should make no real
difference to perl not using unicode connection strings.

You will need a DBI later than 1.607 to support unicode connection
strings because until post 1.607 there was no way for DBI to pass
unicode strings to the DBD.

=head3 Unicode and Oracle

You have to set the environment variables C<NLS_NCHAR=AL32UTF8> and
C<NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8> (or any other language setting
ending with C<.AL32UTF8>) before loading DBD::ODBC to make Oracle
return Unicode data. (See also "Oracle and Unicode" in the POD of
DBD::Oracle.)

On Windows, using the Oracle ODBC Driver you have to enable the B<Force
SQL_WCHAR support> Workaround in the data source configuration to make
Oracle return Unicode to a non-Unicode application. Alternatively, you
can include C<FWC=T> in your connect string.

Unless you need to use ODBC, if you want Unicode support with Oracle
you are better off using L<DBD::Oracle>.

=head3 Unicode and PostgreSQL

Some tests from the original DBD::ODBC 1.13 fail with PostgreSQL
8.0.3, so you may not want to use DBD::ODBC to connect to PostgreSQL
8.0.3.

Unicode tests fail because PostgreSQL seems not to give any hints
about Unicode, so all data is treated as non-Unicode.

Unless you need to use ODBC, if you want Unicode support with Postgres
you are better off with L<DBD::Pg> as it has a specific attribute named
C<pg_enable_utf8> to enable Unicode support.

=head3 Unicode and Easysoft ODBC Drivers

We have tested the Easysoft SQL Server, Oracle and ODBC Bridge drivers
with DBD::ODBC built for Unicode. All work as described without
modification except for the Oracle driver you will need to set you
NLS_LANG as mentioned above.

=head3 Unicode and other ODBC drivers

If you have a unicode-enabled ODBC driver and it works with DBD::ODBC
let me know and I will include it here.

=head2 ODBC Support in ODBC Drivers

=head3 Drivers without SQLDescribeParam

Some drivers do not support the C<SQLDescribeParam> ODBC API (e.g.,
Microsoft Access).

DBD::ODBC uses the C<SQLDescribeParam> API when parameters are bound
to your SQL to find the types of the parameters. If the ODBC driver
does not support C<SQLDescribeParam>, DBD::ODBC assumes the parameters
are C<SQL_VARCHAR> or C<SQL_WVARCHAR> types (depending on whether
DBD::ODBC is built for unicode or not). In any case, if you bind a
parameter and specify a SQL type this overrides any type DBD::ODBC
would choose.

For ODBC drivers which do not support C<SQLDescribeParam> the default
behavior in DBD::ODBC may not be what you want. To change the default
parameter bind type set L</odbc_default_bind_type>. If, after that you
have some SQL where you need to vary the parameter types used add the
SQL type to the end of the C<bind_param> method.

  use DBI qw(:sql_types);
  $h = DBI->connect;
  # set the default bound parameter type
  $h->{odbc_default_bind_type} = SQL_VARCHAR;
  # bind a parameter with a specific type
  $s = $h->prepare(q/insert into mytable values(?)/);
  $s->bind_param(1, "\x{263a}", SQL_WVARCHAR);

=head2 CPAN Testers Reporting

Please, please, please (is that enough), consider installing
CPAN::Reporter so that when you install perl modules a report of the
installation success or failure can be sent to cpan testers. In this
way module authors 1) get feedback on the fact that a module is being
installed 2) get to know if there are any installation problems. Also
other people like you may look at the test reports to see how
successful they are before choosing the version of a module to
install.

CPAN::Reporter is easy to install and configure like this:

  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install CPAN::Reporter
  cpan> reload cpan
  cpan> o conf init test_report

Simply answer the questions to configure CPAN::Reporter.

You can find the CPAN testers wiki at L<http://wiki.cpantesters.org/>
and the installation guide for CPAN::Reporter at
L<http://wiki.cpantesters.org/wiki/CPANInstall>.
